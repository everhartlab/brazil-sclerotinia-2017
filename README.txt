R Project File
==============

On 2017-08-24, Zhian Kamvar has created the Rproject file as an anchor for this project and removed all instances of specific file paths with invocations with the package "here".

DO NOT OPEN THIS Rproj FILE FROM THE BOX FOLDER. Instead, create a new folder where you want to work (e.g. a new folder in your documents called "Thesis Project") and link all the files within the Box folder "Scripts" there. If you open the Rproj file in Box, Rstudio will create a lot of temporary files in a hidden folder that Box will start to sync with no clear way to prevent them from syncing.
